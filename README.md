Hello! My name is Firehawk-Ph4ntom. I'm a passionate CnC player and I've been playing the game since mid 2000s. In 2019 I began modding CnC, and started with Kane's Wrath and Tiberium Wars.
I'm mainly a coder, basic scripter, and do a bit of art as well. I've made 2 mods across from 2019 till now, one for Kane's Wrath called "Tiberium Insanity", the other for Tiberium Wars called "Tiberium Wars FireStorm".
I found modding those games as a nice hobby
