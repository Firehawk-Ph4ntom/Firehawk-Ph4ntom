Hello! I'm Firehawk-Ph4ntom, a passionate Command & Conquer player since the mid-2000s. I began modding in 2019 with Kane's Wrath and Tiberium Wars, where I discovered my passion for understanding and reshaping the mechanics behind the games I love, creating a new experience for myself and other players.

I primarily focus on coding and scripting, with additional experience in a bit of art and design. Over the years, I’ve developed two major mods:
- Tiberium Insanity (Kane's Wrath)
- Tiberium Wars Firestorm (Tiberium Wars)

Modding over time became more than a hobby, and I've been learning and understanding Game Design from these 2 experiences
Outside of modding, I’m pursuing a degree in Computer Science, where I am building projects to strengthen my knowledge in Software Engineering, and also Game Development.
